        <h2>Tsunami</h2>
        <p>
          Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions
          under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not
          dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they
          build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean
          decreases. The speed of tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather
          than the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may
          travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when
          reaching shallow waters. While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal
          waves, this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have
          little to do with these giant waves.

        <h2>Floods</h2>
        <p>
          Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when
          an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are
          often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a
          tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas. Floods can cause
          widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to
          personal property and critical public health infrastructure. Between
          1998-2017, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide.
          People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack
          warning systems and awareness of flooding hazard, are most vulnerable
          to floods.

        <h2>Drought</h2>
        <p>
          Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that
          can occur anywhere in the world. It is a slow-onset disaster
          characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water
          shortage. Drought can have a serious impact on health, agriculture,
          economies, energy and the environment. An estimated 55 million people
          globally are affected by droughts every year, and they are the most
          serious hazard to livestock and crops in nearly every part of the
          world. Drought threatens people’s livelihoods, increases the risk of
          disease and death, and fuels mass migration. Water scarcity impacts
          40% of the world’s population, and as many as 700 million people are
          at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030.

        <h2>Landslide</h2>
        <p>
          Landslides are more widespread than any other geological event, and
          can occur anywhere in the world. They occur when large masses of soil,
          rocks or debris move down a slope due to a natural phenomenon or human
          activity. Mudslides or debris flows are also a common type of
          fast-moving landslide. Landslides can accompany heavy rains or follow
          droughts, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Areas most vulnerable to
          landslides include: steep terrain, including areas at the bottom of
          canyons; land previously burned by wildfires; land that has been
          modified due to human activity, such as deforestation or construction;
          channels along a stream or river; any area were surface runoff is
          directed or land is heavily saturated. Between 1998-2017, landslides
          affected an estimated 4.8 million people and cause more than 18 000
          deaths. Climate change and rising temperatures are expected to trigger
          more landslides, especially in mountainous areas with snow and ice. As
          permafrost melts, rocky slopes can become more unstable resulting in a
          landslide.
